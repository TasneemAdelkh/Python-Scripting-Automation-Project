# Python-Scripting-Automation-Project

This is a simple project covering general ideas of common daily tasks to make sure most of the skills required for day to day automation tasks are passed through, including dealing with command line arguments, copying files or directories, searching files and directories as well as using common automation modules: sys, shutil, os, etc.

## Project Description
The script should be accepting 2 arguments, one for the source directory and the other for a destination directory.
The source directory is a mock-up project directory which simulate a real-world project directory and it contains directories and files for the project.

The "data" directory is the source directory in our example.

## Project Requirements
- Creating another directory(destination directory) with the same name as the second argument.
- Traversing the source directory for the directories containing "game" in them.
- Copying these directories recursively to the destination directory but without the "game" part in their names.
- Creating a JSON file containing information about the games found (Number of games, games names).
- Compiling each go file inside each of the directories (the compiled files should exist each in their corresponding directories). 

## Code Output
- Running the script:
